# 🐍 Battlesnake JavaScript Starter Project

> A simple yet powerful Battlesnake template built using JavaScript for the *Software Development in Practice* university module.

This project is part of our academic coursework and serves as both a foundation for developing a Battlesnake bot and a practical exercise in using Git and GitHub. Throughout development, we practiced working with branches, pull requests, and collaborative version control.
